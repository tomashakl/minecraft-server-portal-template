# Minecraft Server Portal Template

> ⚠️ **Work-in-Progress:** This template has **not yet been tested with a live Minecraft server** (no active MC hosting available at this time).  
> It currently runs as a **fully static website**; the server status feature can be connected later via your own API or proxy if needed.

## How `admin.html` works

`admin.html` is a built-in **Config Editor** that lets you fill in and export your configuration file (`config.json`) — the core of your website’s content.  
Simply open it **locally in your browser** (double-click), fill out the form, and export your ready config file.

### Main controls
- **Apply (Preview):** Saves your current settings for instant preview.  
- **Export config.json:** Downloads the finished configuration file.  
- **Import / Clear Preview:** Load an existing config or clear the current preview data.

### Editable sections
- **Branding:** Website titles, main headline, and slogan.  
- **Theme:** Background image or video, brightness, dim intensity, and fonts.  
- **Server:** Server IP address, status endpoint (optional).  
- **Links:** Discord, website, or other links.  
- **Gallery:** Screenshots and rotation timing.  
- **Content:** Rules, FAQ, News, and Staff members.

> Tip: Use **Apply (Preview)** for instant local testing. Once everything looks right, export the `config.json` file and upload it to your hosting.

## Notes

- Works on **any standard web hosting** — upload your files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `assets/`, and `config.json`).  
- The server status feature is **optional** and can be added later using your own API.  
- If you don’t see updates right away, refresh your browser with **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R** to clear cache.
